# React Json Diff Viewer

This is the renderer for [JYCM](https://github.com/eggachecat/jycm).

Currently there's something wrong with the package `react-monaco-editor` so I can not release the component as a npm package.

Further more the biz codes are all written in React, so this is poorly scalable for other frameworks.

I would release it as a monaco-editor extension so it can be as portable as the monaco editor.
